--More coming--
[[Its just for fun do whatever to it]]

>> Status [theme = Mysterious?]
The weak wither, The strong subsist
The poor shant prevail, The rich replete
But the gods shows its divinity and shall reign over the earth itself
Yet you stand with pride and strength disregarding this knowledge
You vowed to grant this very gift to stand against thy beast
The gift of cosmic terror.

>> Time [theme = Passage of Time]
Time halts, Progression a hundred to none
The decay of matter itself seem to cease
Paradoxes spreading like wild fire
Yet a simple misconception shall make the eternal present shatter.

>> Decaying Hope [Theme = Mistreatment, Disrepected] (Long one incoming!!!)
I train and train and train to get everyone's approval yet,
I get called a pig, a horse or a fly,
Why should I be the one to change?
When people are blinded by fame, money and influencers,
Why can't people just be, normal?

Why do I need to change?
Why do I need to be looked down on?
Why do I need to be always at your service?
Why can't you grovel on the ground like gravel,
Just how you treated me?

Why do I need to eat dirt, and you reign?
Why do I need to become second, just so you could place first?
Why do you treat me like a dog awaiting your command?
I am a normal being just like you, so why..?

I gave everyone kindness, the purest kind,
yet everyone treats me like a racoon in trash...
What do you have to gain from all this?
Are you just here to gain confidence?

I ask myself everyday this, "Am I good enough?",
"Do I even deserve this?", "What is wrong with me?"
These questions have been stabbing me yet
you are admiring my pain, and the torment you made me suffer...

When will this end? When will I regain peace? When will I be free...?

>> Love in interest [Theme = love ig?]
Who knew that the crushing taste of such a sensational feeling could be perceived as weird? 
The interconnection between connections with open gates, the freshness and change of scene, is just immaculate. 
The society might congratulate but most hatred with jealousy. 
Just embrace it.
