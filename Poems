--More coming--
[[Its just for fun do whatever to it]]

>> Status [theme = Mysterious?]
The weak wither, The strong subsist
The poor shant prevail, The rich replete
But the gods shows its divinity and shall reign over the earth itself
Yet you stand with pride and strength disregarding this knowledge
You vowed to grant this very gift to stand against thy beast
The gift of cosmic terror.

>> Time [theme = Passage of Time]
Time halts, Progression a hundred to none
The decay of matter itself seem to cease
Paradoxes spreading like wild fire
Yet a simple misconception shall make the eternal present shatter.
